/**
 * Created by Chen Li on 2018/2/6.
 * Sink to the bottom, then swim
 * Most items reinserted into the heap during sortdown
 * go all the way to the bottom. Floyd observed in 1964 that we can thus save time by
 * avoiding the check for whether the item has reached its position, simply promoting
 * the larger of the two children until the bottom is reached, then moving back up the
 * heap to the proper position. This idea cuts the number of compares by a factor of 2
 * asymptoticallyâ€”close to the number used by mergesort (for a randomly-ordered array)
